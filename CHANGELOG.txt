Current Version: v0.0.1a

9/29/2016 - v0.0.1a
** Fixes **
- Fixed a minor bug with the !volume command.
	~ "Users were able to type in !volume 9001. If you went away for a while and came back then the bot would resume the next song at the same volume. Fun? Not! Lol. Thank Brahmahdawg for this change."

** Added **
- Added a !_volume command.
	~ "To let people still have their silly freedom, I made a !_volume command. You can enter any volume number you want. The difference is that it won't save it. The next time you type !play is when the volume will be overwritten with the previously saved volume."

** Removed **
- !sentient is no longer a command.
	~ "Solus said it was stupid. :("
